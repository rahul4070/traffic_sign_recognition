# traffic_sign_recognition

Traffic sign classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road, including speed limit signs, yield signs, merge signs, etc. Being able to automatically recognize traffic signs enables us to build “smarter cars”.

Self-driving cars need traffic sign recognition in order to properly parse and understand the roadway. Similarly, “driver alert” systems inside cars need to understand the roadway around them to help aid and protect drivers.

Traditionally, standard computer vision methods were employed to detect and classify traffic signs, but these required considerable and time-consuming manual work to handcraft important features in images. Instead, by applying deep learning to this problem, we create a model that reliably classifies traffic signs, learning to identify the most appropriate features for this problem by itself.
